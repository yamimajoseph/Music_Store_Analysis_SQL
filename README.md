## Summary of Findings

• The analysis revealed that Rock music enjoys widespread popularity across a significant number of countries. This suggests that catering to rock fans through targeted promotions or events could be a strategic move.

• The United States emerged as the top contributor in terms of invoice generation. This highlights the importance of this market and potentially warrants focusing marketing efforts or allocating additional resources there.

• Interestingly, Prague emerged as the city with the highest total invoice sum. This city might be an ideal location for a flagship store or a special promotional event to capitalize on its strong customer base.

• Led Zeppelin reigns supreme with the most tracks in our collection (114). Highlighting their music or including exclusive Led Zeppelin merchandise could attract fans and boost sales.
